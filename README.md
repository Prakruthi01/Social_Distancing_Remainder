# Social_Distancing_Remainder
This project aims to create a device that helps maintain social distancing by alerting users when someone comes within 2 meters. It utilizes an Arduino Uno microcontroller, an ultrasound sensor, a touch sensor, a buzzer, and a potentiometer. The device operates in two modes. Mode 1 alerts the user when someone approaches too closely: if the distance is between 2 meters and 1 meter, the LCD backlight lights up and displays a warning; if the distance is between 1 meter and 50 cm, the LCD flashes a more urgent warning; if the distance is less than 50 cm, the LCD backlight flashes rapidly. Mode 2 measures and displays both temperature and distance on the LCD, using a thermistor to improve distance measurement accuracy as the speed of sound varies with temperature.

This user-friendly and portable device is programmed using the Arduino IDE software, compatible with various operating systems. The project's primary goal is to aid in preventing the spread of COVID-19 by ensuring social distancing and identifying high temperatures. Future developments could include making the device wearable, identifying individuals who do not maintain social distance, and recognizing those with elevated temperatures. This innovative approach leverages readily available components to provide an effective solution for a critical public health challenge.
